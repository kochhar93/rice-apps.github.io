# Work with us

Rice Apps would love to hear any opportunities to collaborate and create value for the Rice or General Houston community! Here are our general principles or guidelines that we would like our partners to understand beforehand!

## Our Principles
1. We want to drive value to Rice and to Houston. This means that there is an underserved need available that we can help fill.  
2. We do not work under tight timeline restrictions. We will happily work with you if there is no urgency for delivery and can be flexible with delivery dates.  
3. We are ultimately a learning experience. As a group of Rice students, Rice Apps provides a learning opportunity for its students in a low-pressure, fun environment. This means we cannot guarantee the delivery of projects, and we want to have a positive work experience.
